# Balatro Save and Load Tool

A simple tool that allows you to save your Balatro game at any point, and load it again later.

## How to use

* Hit "Save" whenever you want to save your current run in the selected profile.
* Check "Auto save" if you want the current profile to be saved every X minutes.
* All Saves show up in the list
* To load a save file:
  * In Balatro: go to the main menu (you need to exit your current run)
  * Select the save file in the list, and click "Load". WARNING! Your current run in Balatro will be overwritten!
  * In Balatro: continue your current run, it will be the one you just loaded.
